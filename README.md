# Data-Warehousing-ML-and-EDA
This project was conducted under the internship at Neural Info Solutions, PVT. LTD.

# Task Assigned 1:
1. Set up your Google Colab environment, download the sample_sales_data.csv file and the appropriate task1.ipynb.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis using the notebook to understand statistical properties and identify patterns or anomalies in the data.
3. Reflect on the implications of your findings from both business and data science perspectives.


# Task Assigned 2:
1. Review the data model diagram provided by the Data Engineering team to select relevant sales data and sensor data (temperature, stock levels) that will be used for predictive modeling.
2. Develop a strategic plan detailing the methodology for integrating and analyzing the data to predict hourly stock levels, focusing on machine learning techniques suitable for time-series forecasting.
3. Summarize the data selection rationale and analytical approach in a concise, business-oriented PowerPoint slide for review by the Data Science team leader and the client.

# Task Assigned 3:
1. Merge and preprocess the three provided datasets to create a unified framework for modeling, ensuring data cleanliness and appropriate transformations for predictive accuracy.
2. Apply machine learning techniques to develop a model that can predict hourly stock levels based on historical sales and sensor data, emphasizing time-series forecasting methods.
3. Prepare a PowerPoint slide summarizing the modeling process and results in business-friendly language, highlighting key performance insights and their practical implications for inventory management
